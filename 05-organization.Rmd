## Commenting guidelines

Comment your code. Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: `# `. Comments should explain the why, not the what of your code. \index{comments}

Use commented lines of `-` and `=` to break up your file into easily readable chunks.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load data ---------------------------

# Plot data ---------------------------
```
