# Style guide {#style}

Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread. As with punctuation, there are many ways to style your code that you can choose from, but some ways are more reader-friendly than others. The style presented here is followed throughout the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org). 

This style guide is derived from [Google's R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), but has evolved considerably over the years.

To enforce this style guide automatically, use [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr).
