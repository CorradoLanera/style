# File structure

## File names

File names should be meaningful and end in `.R`. Avoid using special characters in file names - stick with numbers, letters, `-`, and `_`.


    # Good
    fit_models.R
    utility_functions.R

    # Bad
    fit models.R
    foo.r
    stuff.r

If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers:

    0_download.R
    1_parse.R
    2_explore.R

Pay attention to capitalization, since you, or some of your collaborators, might be using an operating system with a case-insensitive file system (e.g., Microsoft Windows or OS X) which can lead to problems with (case-sensitive) revision control systems. Prefer file names that are all lower case, and never have names that differ only in their capitalization.

## Structure 

Use commented lines of `-` and `=` to break up your file into easily readable chunks.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load data ---------------------------

# Plot data ---------------------------
```
