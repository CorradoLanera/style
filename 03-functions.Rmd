# Functions {#style-fun}

Use verbs for function names, where possible.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
add_row()
permute()

# Bad
row_adder()
permutation()
```

Only use `return()` for early returns. Otherwise rely on R to return the result of the last row of a function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
find_abs <- function(x, y){
  if (x > 0) return(x)
  x * -1
}

# Bad
add_two <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y)
}
```

Strive to keep blocks within a function on one screen, so around 20-30 lines maximum.  Some even argue that if a *function* has 20 lines, it should be split into smaller functions.
